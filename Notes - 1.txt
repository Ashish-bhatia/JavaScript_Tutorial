Introducing the DOM

* A document object model is a conceptual way of visulaizing a document and its content.

Each time your browser is asked to load and display a page, it needs to interpret(parse)
the source code contained in the HTML file comprising the page.As part of 
parsing process, the browser creates a type of internal model known as a DOM representation 
based on the content of the loaded document. It is this model that the browser refers to when 
rendering the visible page.
