Introducing the DOM

* A document object model is a conceptual way of visulaizing a document and its content.

Each time your browser is asked to load and display a page, it needs to interpret(parse)
the source code contained in the HTML file comprising the page.As part of 
parsing process, the browser creates a type of internal model known as a DOM representation 
based on the content of the loaded document. It is this model that the browser refers to when 
rendering the visible page.

The window and document objects

Each time your browser loads and display a page, it creates in memory an internal respresentation 
of the page and all its elements, the DOM. In DOM, elements of your web page have a logical, hierarchical structure,
like a tree of interconnected parent and child objects.

In the top if the hierarchical tree is the browser window object. This object ia a parent or 
ancester to everything else in the DOM representation of your page.

Window has various child objects -- Document, Location, History, Mavigator


Including JavaScript in your web page:

1) You can include direct java script statements.
<script>
    Enter your JavaScript Statements here.
</script>
2) You can specify any extra file in same.

<script src = "/home/documents/as.js"> </script>

3) You can use any links JS in your code.

<script src="www.g.com/as.js"></script>

4) Point to be note is that you can use multiple times
<script> tag.

5) Sometime it makes sense to store multiple variable values under a single variable name. JavaScript has array data type 
to help you on this. 
    An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in a single variable.
    Each value has a numeric index that may contain data of any data type - Booleans, numbers, strings, functions,
    objects and even other arrays.
6) Conditional statements, as the name implies, are used to detect particular conditions arising in the values
    of variables you are using in your script. 
    We saw Boolean variables, which can take two values - True/False. 
7) Procedural programming: Procedural programming is characterized by having data stored in variables, which are operated on by lists
of instruction. Each instruction ( or list of instructions, such as function) can create, destory modify the data,
yet the data always remains somehow "separate" from the program code.
8) In OOPS concept, the program instructions and the data on which they operate are more interwined. OOP is a way of conceptualizing a program's data into 
descrete "things" referred to as objects -- Each having its own properties data and method(instructions)
9) benefits of OOP: - Code Reuse
                    - Encapsulation 
                    - Inheritence

10) javascript offers several ways to create an object.
    a) Create a direct instance -- JavaScript has a built in object simply called Object that you can use as a kind of blank 
    canvas.
