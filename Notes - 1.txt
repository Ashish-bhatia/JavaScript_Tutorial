Introducing the DOM

* A document object model is a conceptual way of visulaizing a document and its content.

Each time your browser is asked to load and display a page, it needs to interpret(parse)
the source code contained in the HTML file comprising the page.As part of 
parsing process, the browser creates a type of internal model known as a DOM representation 
based on the content of the loaded document. It is this model that the browser refers to when 
rendering the visible page.

of the page and all its elements, the DOM. In DOM, elements of your web page have a logical, hierarchical structure,
like a tree of interconnected parent and child objects.

ancester to everything else in the DOM representation of your page.

Window has various child objects -- Document, Location, History, Mavigator
