        <script type="text/javascript">  // Tag to include JavaScript in HTML. 
        document.getElementById("Paragraph").innerHTML ="<i>The value is updated using JavaScript</i>";
        /* Take Aways - getElementById is the method with which we can identify any Tag with a defined id.
                      - with innerHTML we can set its value. 
                      - So intially we set the value as "This is first Paragraph" while we run on browser we see the value from javascript.
