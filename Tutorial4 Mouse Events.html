    <body>
       <input type="button" onclick="alert('you clicked the button')" value ="click Me"/> 
       <input type="button" onmouseover="alert('you hover over  the button')" value ="hover over me"/> 
       <input type="button" onmouseout="alert('you move away the button')" value ="come and leave me"/> 


<!-- Take Aways: - You dont need script tag to perform these events.
                       - onclick event will be registered only if u click.
                       - onmouseover event will trigger as soon as u bring mouse on that.
                       - onMouseOut event will be triggered when you leave over the button. 
                       - Although there is no Script Tag these are still part of JavaScript -->
