        /* Take Aways: - JavaScript has the means to parcel up parts of your code into reusable modules, called function.
                       - keyword "function" must be in lower case.
                       - defination n calling both are important.
                       - You can define one function one time and use it again and again.
                       - alert will just give a pop up to user.
